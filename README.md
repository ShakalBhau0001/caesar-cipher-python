## 🔐 Caesar Cipher Implementation (Python)

A simple and educational **Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm.**
This project demonstrates **left and right shifting encryption and decryption** using basic character manipulation and modular arithmetic.

It is created as a **learning and academic project** to understand how classical cryptography works internally, not as a production-ready security system.

## ✨ Features

### 🔁 Left & Right Shift Support
- User can choose:
  - `L` → Left Shift
  - `R` → Right Shift
- Demonstrates both encryption directions for learning clarity

### 🔒 Encryption
- Encrypts alphabetic characters using a shift key
- Preserves uppercase and lowercase letters
- Keeps spaces and special characters unchanged

### 🔓 Decryption
- Automatically decrypts using the opposite shift direction
- Verifies correctness of the algorithm

### 🧮 Educational Focus
- Clean and readable logic
- Uses modular arithmetic (`% 26`)
- Ideal for beginners in cryptography
- No external dependencies

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShakalBhau0001/caesar-cipher-python.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd caesar-cipher-python
```

### 3️⃣ Run the program
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Follow the prompts
- Enter a message
- Enter a shift key (integer)
- Choose direction:
  - `L` for Left Shift
  - `R` for Right Shift
- View encrypted and decrypted output

---

## 🔎 Example

```bash
Enter message: HELLO
Enter shift key: 3
Choose direction (L = Left, R = Right): R

Encrypted Message: KHOOR
Decrypted Message: HELLO
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not secure for real-world use
- Classical cipher (easily breakable)
- No brute-force protection
- CLI-based interaction only

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Add brute-force mode
- Add English frequency scoring
- Add input validation for shift values
- Add file encryption support
- Create GUI version

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This implementation is created **for educational and learning purposes only.**
The Caesar Cipher is a historically important but insecure encryption method and must not be used to protect real-world sensitive data.
